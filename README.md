# Casper Meets Wendy
A Ghost-inspired WordPress theme with good taste in crimefighters.

## Description

This theme was inspired by <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper">Casper</a>. It was built with <a href="http://underscores.me/">_s</a> for my own use at <a href="http://carolinesyrup.com">carolinesyrup.com</a> after I couldn't find what I was looking for in the theme directory. 

It's been tested somewhat thoroughly and you should feel free to use it in your own projects. However, I make no promises for updates or support. Use at your own risk!
